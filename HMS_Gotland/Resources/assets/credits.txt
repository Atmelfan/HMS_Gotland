Why did you do that!? Doors doesn't magiclly open because you shot it!
For the last time! Don't shot the doors, they won't open faster because you shoot at them.
Ok, let's talk. Drones are bad, shoot them. Doors are god, don't shoot them.
Why do you hate doors so much!? What have they ever done to you?
Ok, I give up. Shoot the doors if you hate them so much.

Hurry up!
You shoot innocent doors on sight but not evil computers?

Ok, try to keep your bullets down, we happen to be in space you know.

I'm hungry! Too bad these toasters doesn't make toasts.

Luckily they didn't give them flamethrowers or rocket launchers!
